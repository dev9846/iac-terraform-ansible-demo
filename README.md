##  Overview

This project demonstrates a production-ready Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) pipeline using:

* **Terraform** (modular structure)
* **Packer** (for baking secure AMIs)
* **Ansible** (for NGINX + HTTPS configuration)
* **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD automation)

It provisions a secured EC2 instance on AWS with NGINX configured to serve over **HTTPS** using a self-signed certificate.

---

##  Architecture

```text
GitHub Actions
    |
    |---> Packer builds hardened AMI with Ansible
    |
    |---> Terraform deploys infra using that AMI

Outputs:
  - Encrypted EC2 instance
  - NGINX with SSL (self-signed)
  - Security Group 
```

## Tools Used

* **Terraform**: – To provision AWS infrastructure
* **Ansible**: – To configure the EC2 instance with NGINX and HTTPS
* **Packer**: – (Bonus) To build a pre-configured AMI with Ansible
* **GitHub Actions**: – CI pipeline for validating and applying Terraform code


---

## Security Highlights

* **Disk Encryption**: EBS volumes encrypted via AWS KMS
* **SSL Enabled**: NGINX serves over HTTPS (self-signed)
* **No Secrets in Code**: All credentials managed via GitHub Secrets


---

##  GitHub Actions Pipeline

*  **Build AMI** using Packer with Ansible
*  **Extract AMI ID** and write to Terraform tfvars
*  **Apply infrastructure** via Terraform in `env/dev`
*  **Run on push to `main` or manual dispatch**

---

##  Getting Started (Local)

### Prerequisites

* AWS CLI + credentials with EC2/IAM/S3 access
* Terraform
* Packer
* Python + Ansible

### Manual Steps

```bash
# Build AMI
cd packer
packer build nginx-python3.8-ami.json

# Update AMI ID in env/dev/terraform.tfvars

# Deploy infrastructure
cd ../../env/dev
terraform init
terraform apply
```

---

##  Features

* Full automation from AMI to deployment
* Modular, reusable Terraform code
* Production-style Ansible provisioning baked into AMI
* CI/CD that runs cleanly on push to `main` with option to skip CI/CD if mention [Skip ci] in comment.
* Secure-by-default infrastructure

---

##  TODO (Future Enhancements)

* [ ] Use Let's Encrypt instead of self-signed SSL
* [ ] Add tfsec or Checkov security scans
* [ ] Use GitHub OIDC instead of access keys
* [ ] Add CloudWatch logging and alarms
* [ ] Rolling deployments using `create_before_destroy`
