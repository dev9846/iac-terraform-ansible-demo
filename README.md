Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible, Packer with HTTPS &amp; NGINX on AWS

# Infrastructure as Code: Terraform + Ansible + Packer on AWS

This project demonstrates a complete infrastructure-as-code workflow using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Packer** to provision and configure an NGINX web server on AWS with HTTPS enabled. GitHub Actions is used for CI/CD.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- **Terraform** â€“ To provision AWS infrastructure
- **Ansible** â€“ To configure the EC2 instance with NGINX and HTTPS
- **Packer** â€“ (Bonus) To build a pre-configured AMI with Ansible
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ CI pipeline for validating and applying Terraform code

Features:

VPC with public subnet and IGW
EC2 instance with SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS security group
Ansible installs and configures NGINX with a self-signed SSL cert
Packer builds a reusable AMI with preinstalled NGINX
GitHub Actions automates Terraform format/validate and plan

Setup Prerequisites

AWS CLI with credentials configured
Terraform >= 1.3
Ansible
Packer (optional)
SSH key pair created in AWS

# Notes:
1. Make sure you have s3 backend bucket already created and use it in backend.
2. Create a key pair in AWS EC2 Console and update key_name in terraform.tfvars. Ensure the downloaded .pem is available locally for SSH access.

Deploy:
cd env/dev
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

Run Ansible:
ansible-playbook -i inventory ../ansible/nginx_setup.yml
